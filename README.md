# Godot 4.1 Grass Test

Using GPUParticles3D to create a grass field. No frustum magic yet.

**`You can use all code and assets in this project for free. Create amazing things!`**

Extra Info, each blade of grass is `0.811296m tall and have 3 verts`. I'd `make it exactly 1m next time` so that it's easier to work with.
